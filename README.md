# Excel-Project
This Excel project analyzes data from Tech-Moms, focusing on applicants who have been assigned to cohorts. The dataset includes key information about these applicants, such as their household income, computer availability, employment status, salary range, relationship and marital status, race/ethnicity, and details about their children.

Key questions addressed in the analysis include:

Household Income: What is the household income of applicants assigned to a cohort?
Cohort Participation: How many students are in each cohort, and what is the total number of applicants assigned to cohorts?
Education Levels: What are the educational backgrounds of the applicants in cohorts?
Demographics: What is the race/ethnicity distribution among applicants assigned to cohorts? What is their relationship status?
Technology Access: What is the computer availability status for those in cohorts, and what percentage of applicants do not have laptops?
Family Size: What is the total number of children across all applicants, and what is the average number of children for those assigned to cohorts?
Veteran and LGBTQ+ Representation: What percentage of applicants are veterans, and how many identify as LGBTQ+?
Educational Attainment: What percentage of applicants have a bachelor's degree?
Support for Children: What is the total number of children supported by applicants in cohorts, and what is the maximum number of children any applicant has?
This project provides valuable insights into the demographics and characteristics of Tech-Moms applicants, which can inform program development and targeted support initiatives. The analysis not only highlights trends but also identifies potential areas for intervention to better assist families within the cohorts.
